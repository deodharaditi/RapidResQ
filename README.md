## Problem Statement 🚨
Daily emergency medical incidents pose a threat to lives due to limited and untimely medical assistance. The Emergency Medical Service (EMS) sector faces high risks, with injuries and fatalities for both responders and the public. Inefficient fund allotment processes within EMS enterprises hinder operations, demanding a streamlined approach. An urgent need exists for a digital platform that ensures efficient fund allocation, prioritizes safety, and utilizes data analytics for early patient tracking, reducing casualties in emergency situations.

## Proposed Solution 💡
1. **SOS Tracking System**: Empower individuals facing medical emergencies (patients) with a user-friendly SOS button on our website. This feature enables real-time tracking of patients in distress, ensuring swift response and assistance.

2. **Efficient Request Routing**: Streamline the emergency medical request process by seamlessly routing requests through all necessary enterprises and organizations. This rapid and organized workflow ensures that the patient receives prompt assistance during critical situations.

3. **Comprehensive Healthcare Management**: Provide users with a comprehensive healthcare solution that goes beyond emergencies. Our platform facilitates routine checkups and integrates a lab testing feature, offering users a holistic healthcare experience.

4. **Optimized Equipment Request Management**: Implement a robust system for managing equipment or tool requests. Requests are efficiently routed to the Billing Organization, and approvals are based on available funds. This ensures judicious use of resources, preventing unnecessary expenses and optimizing fund utilization.

## Approach 🛠️
The most important part of our system is going to be “work requests” of all kinds:
- Passing the request from one enterprise to the other
- Passing the request from one organization to the other
- Maintaining Work Queue and Work Request for a User Account and Organization

### Work Requests Include:
1. Ambulance Work Request
2. Billing Work Request
3. Doctor Checkup Work Request
4. Doctor Work Request
5. Emergency Patient Request
6. Equipment Work Request
7. Lab Test Work Request
